### Auxillaries
For each auxillary column in harmonized_raw, the following columns will be added (datatype and unit will be carried over from harmonized raw):


| Column name | Data type | Unit | Sample data | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| aux_[xx]_[xx]_mean | float | unit | 25.3 | Arithmetic mean of xxx during cycle |
| aux_[xx]_[xx]_mean_tw | float | unit | 25.3 | Time-weighted mean of xxx during cycle |
| aux_[xx]_[xx]_max | float | unit | 25.3 | Maximum xxx value during cycle |
| aux_[xx]_[xx]_min | float | unit | 25.3 | Minimum xxx value during cycle |


## Open questions & Follow-ups
- need very good documentation how each of those columns is actually calculated
- If a cycle has multiple charge and discharge steps:
  - document which value is taken for
    - ir_start_charge, ir_start_discharge etc.
    - relaxation_potential_charge, relaxation_potential_discharge
    - open_circuit_potential_charge, open_circuit_potential_discharge	
- How to deal with dedicated resistance steps (e.g. as included in Arbins)?
- Resistances at different time scales?
- We have cc and cv shares - what about cp?
  - What additional columns would make sense with respect to CP?
- Should we also have cv_discharge_capacity etc.? (even though CCCV is more common for charge)
- Should we split auxillaries into charge and discharge as well?
- Check summary tables for PEC data from Preben
- Mask (Boolean) - how should this be included?
- Any other cumulated values to be added?


Doublecheck if we have
- charge and discharge difference
- Coulombic/Energy/Power efficiency
