# Definitions of headers and other constants

"""
This module contains definitions of headers and other constants.

Planned features:
- It should also contain a custom dict-like object that can be used to store
the settings. It should allow for both "dot notation" and "bracket notation" to access the keys.
- It should work well with both Polars and Pandas.

Other ideas:
- Also include the units used by cellpycore. Could be a good idea to have a object that 
has convenient methods for converting between units, or make using e.g. pint easier for the coders.
